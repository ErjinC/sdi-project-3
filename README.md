EVENT-TOOLY (Extremely Versatile Event Navigation Tool - Timetable Organization Object LibrarY) is a basic scheduling application that allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and sign up for events.

On the homepage, users can start creating an event on "Create Event" and "Click Here to Get Started!". They can start viewing events by clicking the calendar. A list of highlighted events sorted by attendees continuously scrolls, and clicking on one will redirect the user to its respective details page. Users can also access a review page for the app.

To create an event, users can click on the "Create Event" button on the header. They must fill out all areas on the form except for the optional image. The calendar page shows all the events for a particular month, and double clicking on a day will show all the events for that day. Further details about the event can be seen after clicking on the event you want to view. Clicking "Edit Event" will send you to an autopopulated form that you can change that will update the existing event after you finalize changes. "Delete Event" will delete the event and remove it from the calendar.

Users may also search for an event by event name, organizer, location, and details.
